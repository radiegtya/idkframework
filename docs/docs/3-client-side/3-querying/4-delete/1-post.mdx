Delete a record from `Post` table

## Request

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="rest_api" label="REST API" default>
  To <b>delete</b> a record using REST API, you need to have an <code>id</code> from a <code>Post</code> record, after that send a <code>DELETE</code> request to <code>/posts/:id</code> endpoint

```md title="[DELETE]"
/posts/:id
```

For example, we will <b>delete</b> a <code>Post</code> with an id <code>6c976b04-05dc-4a6e-8154-0c82ecc21b59</code>

```md title="[DELETE]"
/posts/6c976b04-05dc-4a6e-8154-0c82ecc21b59
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js_sdk" label="Javascript SDK">
  To <b>delete</b> a record using our Javascript SDK, you must install <code>@idk/client</code> from <code>npm</code>

```bash
# npm
npm install @idk/client

# yarn
yarn add @idk/client
```

after installing, you must import <code>IDKClient</code> from <code>@idk/client</code> and use that to **delete** a <code>Post</code> record like below

```javascript
import { IDKClient } from "@idk/client";

const idk = new IDKClient();

const deletePost = async () => {
  const post = await idk.posts.delete("6c976b04-05dc-4a6e-8154-0c82ecc21b59");

  return post;
};
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
